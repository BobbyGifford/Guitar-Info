      description1:
        "A guitar nut is the part that guides the strings down the fretboard. They are commonly made of plastic on cheap guitars. On expensive guitars they are usually made of animal bone.",
        description2: "A narrow nut results in a strings being closer together. A wider nut width results in wider string space. Fenders nut widths use 1 5/8, which is very narrow. Gibson uses 1 11/16 which is standard.",
        description3: "It is the most underrated part of the guitar. If the nut is too high, your strings will be too high. This results in your guitar being extremely difficult to play. If your nut is too low your strings will buzz and your guitar will not work.",
        description4: "A luthier should be able to set these up with ease.",
      factors: "string height, string spacing, bends, and tuning stability.",

      topic: "Bridge",
      location: "body",
      description1: "A bridge controls tuning stability by its saddles. Saddles are the metal portion that the strings make contact with. Saddles must be adjusted to get proper tuning. They move up (toward the neck) and down (away from the neck).  In this picture you can see screw pushing up the saddles to form a T shape. ",
      description2: "A bridge also controls string height. A saddle can also be screwed down closer into the body, resulting in the string being closer to the fretboard. ",
      description3: "Each bridge type is radically different. Its best to let a luthier adjust these. ",
      factors: "tuning, and string height.",

      topic: "Scale Length",
      location: "neck",
      description1: "Scale length is the distance from the nut to the saddles on the bridge. This affects string tension (how tight your strings feel). ",
      description2: "Fender uses a standard of 25.5inches which is common. Gibson uses a standard of 24.75 inches which is short. ",
      description3: "A longer scale generally has better sustain, but is harder to bend on. Shorter scale guitars like Gibsons are often used by blues players because of how easy they are to achieve large bends. ",
      description4: "Shorter scale guitar strings also have a looser feel to them. ",
      factors: "string tension, sustain, and bends.",

      topic: "Radius",
      location: "neck",
      description1: "A radius is how curved the surface of the fretboard is. A curved fretboard is easier to form chords on, but much harder to bend on. A curved fretboard also requires higher string height. ",
      description2: "A flat fretboard is easier to get lower string height and bend on. Flatter fretboards are known for being easier to play fast and solo on. ",
      description3: "Fenders are notorious for having a very curved radius, usually 9.5”. Gibsons are known for having a flat radius, almost always 12”. ",

      location: "neck",
      description1: "Frets are the metal lines that your strings make contact with when you play. Frets have two import factors that control the entire feel of you guitar, material and size. ",
      description2: "Fret material indicates what the fret is made of.  Almost every retail guitar frets are made of nickel. Nickel frets wear out over the course of several years. Eventually they will need to be leveled or replaced. ",
      description3: "Stainless steel frets are almost indestructible. They never wear and are easier to bend on. ",
      description4: "Fret size indicates how wide and high they are. Higher frets are easier to bend on and have better sustain. Any modern guitar will have medium-jumbo sized frets.",
      factors: "bends, sustain, and fret life",
